# SteamTrush

SteamTrush is a simple experimental tool for managing multiple Steam accounts.
It demonstrates how to login with SteamKit2, fetch XP via the Steam Web API and
launch Counter-Strike 2 from different accounts. The application supports both
English and Russian languages.

## Building
1. Install the .NET 7 SDK.
2. Run `dotnet restore` and `dotnet run` inside the `SteamManager` directory.

## Configuration
Create an `accounts.json` file with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "Username": "user1",
    "Password": "pass1",
    "SteamId": "7656119...",
    "ApiKey": "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
]
```

Set the environment variable `STEAM_MANAGER_LANG` to `ru` for Russian UI.
