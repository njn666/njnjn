# SteamTrush

SteamTrush is a Windows desktop tool for managing multiple Steam accounts.
It provides a modern WPF interface where you can view XP, launch Counter‑Strike 2
and send trade offers. Accounts can be added directly inside the application and
the language can be switched between English and Russian on the fly.

## Building
1. Install the .NET 8 SDK with Windows desktop support. On Linux you can use the [dotnet-install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script).
2. Run `dotnet restore` and then
   `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true`.
   This creates a stand‑alone executable that does not require .NET to be installed.
3. Launch `publish/SteamManager.exe` from `SteamManager/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64`.
   During development you can run `dotnet run --project SteamManager/SteamManager.csproj` to start the UI immediately.

Continuous builds run on GitHub Actions using the included workflow in `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml`.

## Configuration
On first run you can load accounts from an optional `accounts.json` file with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "Username": "user1",
    "Password": "pass1",
    "SteamId": "7656119...",
    "ApiKey": "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
]
```

Set the environment variable `STEAM_MANAGER_LANG` to `ru` for Russian UI.
You can also add new accounts directly within the application using the fields
below the account table.
