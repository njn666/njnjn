# SteamTrush

SteamTrush is a Windows desktop tool for managing multiple Steam accounts.
It provides a modern WPF interface where you can view XP, launch Counter‑Strike 2
and send trade offers. Accounts can be added directly inside the application and
the language can be switched between English and Russian on the fly. The main
window lists all accounts with their XP and recent drops in a dark theme.

## Building
1. Install the .NET 8 SDK with Windows desktop support. On Linux you can use the [dotnet-install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script).
2. Run `dotnet restore` and then
  `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true`.
   This creates a stand‑alone executable that does not require .NET to be installed.
3. Launch `publish/SteamManager.exe` from `SteamManager/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64`.
   During development you can run `dotnet run --project SteamManager/SteamManager.csproj` to start the UI immediately.

Continuous builds run on GitHub Actions using the included workflow in `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml`.

## Configuration
On first run you can load accounts from an optional `accounts.json` file with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "Username": "user1",
    "Password": "pass1",
    "SteamId": "7656119...",
    "ApiKey": "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
]
```

Set the environment variable `STEAM_MANAGER_LANG` to `ru` for Russian UI.
You can also add new accounts directly within the application using the inputs
below the account table. Each field is labeled so you know where to enter the
username, password, Steam ID and API key. After filling them in, press
**Add Account**. Use the **Launch** and **Trade** buttons to start CS2 or send
items for the selected account.

If Steam is installed in a non-standard location, set the `STEAM_EXE`
environment variable to the full path of `steam.exe` so the launcher can find it.
